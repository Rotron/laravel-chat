# Super simple chat application in Laravel

This is an extremely simple chat application that uses goodness of [Pusher](https://pusher.com/). Everything works on Laravel's event system and it's built-in support for Pusher.

It can be also used with Redis just with one simple change - the driver (requires literally few clicks) if you want to use it on your own websocket server.
